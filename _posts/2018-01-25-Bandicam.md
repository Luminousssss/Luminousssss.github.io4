“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”

Adapted from the "Anekdote zur Senkung der Arbeitsmoral" by Heinrich Böll
